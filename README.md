# Numpy-Pandas-Data-Analysis-Practice
Data analysis bootcamp practice using pandas and numpy library in Jupyter notebook by Maven Course lectured by Chris Bruehl.
Hi, my name is Jopi Adrianto Doloksaribu, thank you for passing by.
in this repository, i would like to showcase you my portfolio of the practice i did when i was learning python for data analysis.
In this practice, i used numpy and pandas as the library for data analysis, and matplotlib and seaborn as the data visualization tools.
The code itself is written in Jupyter Notebook.
By the end of this bootcamp, i managed to learn data visualization and data analysis and python itself as a language for data analysis.
You can check all the files in the repository [here](https://github.com/adjopi20/Numpy-Pandas-Data-Analysis-Practice).

Should you have any enquiry feel free to email [me](mailto: jopi.adrianto@gmail.com)

Thank you!
